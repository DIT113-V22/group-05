WHAT:
First tier: Develop an embedded system integrated with the microcontroller-chip, which in turn will give us full control over the SmartCar. Using an app or website.
Second tier: Create a system where the car would register objects heading towards the car. Which would make the car avoid it by driving to the side or back up.
Third tier: If time permits, then we would like to develop a mini-game.(the tag game?). We would like to collaborate with another team for this game or possibly have a bot/support for multiple players. Open map where you collect the most coins possible in a certain amount of time. 
Fourth tier: Adding it to the physical SmartCar, as our focus will be primarily the “emulator-car”.

WHY:
The idea is to permit the car to recognize obstacles and other SmartCars. This would be the first step towards self-driving cars, guide and assist with parking, prevent car collisions, thus decreasing accidents. 
According to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide in 2016. That is, one person is killed every 25 seconds. 

Our second priority would be to challenge ourselves on a more fun note. Creating a game to further expand our understanding in embedded code and learn how to hack the emulator to create a platform for our game
Our final challenge will be to bring our code into the physical because we want to see our code interact in the physical for the first time and it would allow us to learn more about the challenges of transferring code from a theoretical point of view to more of a practical one. Due to the fact the physical world has many undeterminable factors that cannot be emulated in the simulation (for example, friction, reflections, sunlight/shading, etc.).

HOW:
Learning more about the emulator in general, and using github to keep track and document our progress. We would break into teams to divide up the workload. We would then bring our work back together to ensure the code still works together and for testing purposes.
Accessing sensors (for example: Infrared, Ultrasonic sensor, camera), would allow the car to scan its environment and register obstacles in its surroundings. If the sensors would pick up an object getting closer it would move out of its path. 
We will develop an app using Android Studio and connect it to the Godot Emulator to be able to control the car in the virtual environment. We would then aim to implement support to control the physical car with the developed app.
For the game we will create our own custom mod using the Godot Editor.
Using blender would allow us to create a different map, for example a racetrack, for the mini-game. 

List of items we would need: 
- Godot Editor 
- SMCE Godot emulator
- Arduino IDE
- Android Studio 
- Github
- Blender
